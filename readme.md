# Chao Examiner

Module to load, examine and manipulate Chao data for Sonic Adventure 2 save data.

## TODO

1. CLI argument,
    * Find the save-file,
2. Document,
    * What it currently does,
    * Why I've not got it writing back to the original (seems like there's check-bytes),
3. Tests for the data sets,
4. Pretty extraction of non-chao data
    * Ideally set up to be able to work out what's going on next time I'm working with this,
5. Stick it on GitHub,
